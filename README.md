# cognitive-functions-questions
## About
This is a full TUI application implementing [this prezi file](https://prezi.com/view/Sxqm08Zn2icygS2dYLWx/)

Questions and personality information are in `json` files. `Question` is a class and tree structure that 
is the basis for how it works.

## Running the program
```bash
python3 main.py
```

## TODO:
* `result_info.json` could have `content` separated into a list of string (paragraphs), rather than one giant paragraph.
* Make the `main` user interface function a little cleaner.
