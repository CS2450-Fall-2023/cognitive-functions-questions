        "content": "The quest for more knowledge, the meaning of life, the philosophical questions-my mind is always occupied, and what's exciting is when I get to follow through with an insight and do something. I am an abstract future thinker, looking at things from different perspectives. I'm about the relationships and possibilities and enjoy anything with deeper meaning that leaves me wondering, with more questions to ask and things to untangle. Connecting for me means being able to intuitively ask questions of people to get them to go deeper into the things they are talking about Inspiring others, helping them find their purpose or meaning, being a different kind of leader from what's traditional-that's really gratifying. I just do that naturally. The challenge is opening up people's minds to have their own original thoughts. I'm a listener and guide. I think I am a mystery to people. They never really understand me and part of me enjoys that. More often though, I long to be understood. I tend to approach my day with a structured way of getting things accomplished. People see me as organized, thorough, and easy to get along with, pulling my own weight and eager to help out when called upon. But I'm not as outgoing or as critical as I may sometimes appear. I need a balance between people contact and working on creative projects and will break away from interactions when I get tired out. If I don't have some long-term goals, then what's the point? I tend to intuitively read people very quickly, but I have to be cautious not to make assumptions. I'm an observer. I get a feeling when people are interesting, and I watch from a distance, make some assessments about the situation, and then approach them and engage in conversation. I put a little bit out and a little more and see how that goes. Do I trust and like them, are they who they say? I have a few deep friendships. A friendship comes best when it is worked to develop that investment. I quickly pick up on sincerity and withdraw if the person is superficial or obviously doesn't care. When I see people who abuse their power or won't stand behind what they say, that ticks me off. It's about integrity. I feel other people's feelings, and taking on that burden can make me too intense and serious, where I can't be spontaneous and fun loving... Everything revolves around growth. Caring is about the ability to help others grow. What I bring is caring about people, not things. If we spent more time trying to understand each other's point of view, to communicate more effectively, we would grow. In an honest, open, sincere relationship, I can accomplish anything. My challenge is to create those kinds of relationships. I respect most the person who is willing to come forth and be an individual-to make the world a better place, or make a difference in a person's life, where we reach each other's hearts."

I'm a team player but I work best with some time alone. I like it when everything is laid out and I can just concentrate on doing the job. I hate it when I don't know where I am going, and I like feedback so I know I'm on the right track. If part of the job entails ambiguity. that's fine just as long as the goal is to reduce ambiguity. I like being financially secure with the bills paid on time so my family can enjoy the things that we like to do. I like to have a fallback plan. I do like to laugh and have fun too, but work is more important to me, and then I make my little jokes. I always think I have to get my work done before I can go out or go home. when I can just sit down and relax without anything hanging over my head. I take responsibility seriously, and if I'm going to put my name on something, my desire is to insure it's as good as it can be. A sense of right and wrong is extremely important, and I will not just stand by and watch people doing things wrong. It really tears me apart. I tend to want things in order and people doing the right things. I want to have some rules. I always wanted to please people, and a safe environment to me is where I don't have to compete with anyone else's wishes. If I get into a situation where I feel very strongly and can't articulate the words or can't win, I just don't say anything. I tend to put up with conflict rather than deal with it. I try to deal with stress, but I am not necessarily a good confronter. I would like to be more of a stress avoider. I find myself duty bound sometimes and find that I do things because of what's expected of me. People can trust and count on me. and I am very dependable, almost to a fault. I strive to keep balance between work and home, and if I'm going to provide for my family I'm going to have to swallow some things at work. When I see families that really want to be together, that's a relationship that those people worked at for many years to achieve. Being a friend means caring enough about an individual to call them to see how they are doing, and if I can see someone has held true to their word, then they've probably gained my trust. If you were to ask me to define the word love. you would get responses like caring, responsibility, and loyalty. I get up in the morning and do my routine. And I take time at the end of each day to try to plan what's happening the next day, what I'm going to be working on first, second, third, and so on through out the day, to eliminate the unexpected. Sometimes I might carry a book or something in case I have to wait somewhere. That makes life easy and full. Stability is important to me and change may not be that easy, but variety is good too. I seek advice when I need to change."

It's like being caught in a time warp. I tend to be someone who looks at all the what-ifs, thinking way ahead with a vision of things and anticipating. I'm always interested in extending myself into areas I don't do well in. I'm a good problem solver from that perspective. I like to go through anything I can think of before I act-the implications, what others have tried before and their effect, my options and their consequences, who to mobilize and in what time frame. I like coming up with new ideas about how to approach a situation until I find a solution that feels right. And I like to think that solution will be something that works for everyone. I experience problems as challenges, not as things that can't be dealt with or accomplished. Challenges can always be dealt with. I am naturally organized, structured, and analytical. If a project enters my mind it immediately assumes the form of its pieces, its basic structure, and what order-first, next, last-it will take to get it done. This isn't something I do, it happens instantaneously without effort. Issues are multifaceted and I try to think from different perspectives, not only my perspectives but others' too. And I've found it's good to gather as many facts as I can. Sometimes there is a piece that needs to be thrown out, or maybe it's the seed of another project. I won't do something if I feel I can't do it well. I prefer trying something, then critique after the fact. I will integrate the experience and never make the same mistakes again. I am satisfied when things work well, and I like to improve people's lives by reorganizing and introducing things in an understandable way that is explicit and clear and makes sense. Then someone else can come in and take over. I set very high standards for myself, and I believe it is possible to be competent at anything and everything I set my mind to.. Autonomy is important, to be respected for my own thoughts and feelings, ideas and creativity. I am turned off when people try to discredit my ideas or don't listen before they even understand, or when people don't try to do the best they can or fight against progress. And if the emotional piece is not well managed in my life, or not compartmentalized, work is very difficult. Chitchat is tedious. I don't know what to say, and I figure the other person isn't actually interested in me anyway. Over time I have built a world-view, like constructing a map of the cosmos, and from this, essentially everything is understandable and anything is possible. All the things I've done, have been self-taught by picking up on or asking myself good, clear, penetrating questions to expose and articulate the hidden structures that underlie the experience of living."

There is an answer, and I just need to get to the best way to figure it out-to meet my objectives and give it to people how it is without annoying anyone To work with difficult situations I become very logical and very analytical, and I look to see where things fit. I always watch and if there's a problem, I go back inside myself to see what may need to be done and how best to approach a situation. I like to find a technique. The observational part of me is the ability to see when an opportunity exists and to actually act on it and make things a little bit better. I like to choose the timing for when it's appropriate to say or do something. I spend a lot of time considering scenarios before I make decisions. I'll usually go with a hunch, my intuition, what's the most likely cause. I do my best problem solving in my head away from whatever it is. I step back outside of things, think for a while, and make adjustments-could this be better than that, how do these react, and how does the whole system go together? I'm willing to do the upfront work, which makes it expedient because I never have to repeat it. In my work, I don't want to be just doing stuff for the sake of doing stuff. I like to accomplish things-make a contribution. That's real important. I take a \"do it\" type of approach. It's very practical. It's very here and now. That does not mean I don't take into consideration the big picture and what's down the road and what's best for the organization, but at the same time my big focus is \"let's get this show on the road and let's do it.\" I do it as well as I can. Then I think very well on my feet. I can be quick with the verbal comeback-I like the impact. I just get in there and do it, and whatever job I go into, I hit the ground running. And I'm very competitive, often with myself. I tie one hand behind my back and see if I can still do it... I like flexibility in what I do. Fun means something that interests me. Organized things don't come to me easily, but I can do them. I've always found ways to make things fun. It's a game to make sure you can come to the next point where you have freedom again There's something insincere about doing something just because of somebody or something else.

Then I can get introspective, going very deep and staying there, not coming out too quickly or easily. Somehow I find it very difficult to put into words and communicate the things that really matter to me. Most people don't have the foggiest notion about what goes on with me. I like harmony and seek consensus and do well with the deep issues. My values and the things that are important to me often feel outside the mainstream in the sense that I feel impinged upon and uncomfortable with so much of what goes on. I'm too private to push my values on to other people, but I am convinced that one ought to be congruent in their own life if they are going to expect congruence from others. In a sense I hold other people to that standard, and I worry about my own incongruities, inconsistencies, and contradictions. Groups can be hard. I can put myself in the group process so rapidly and so completely, and it's important not to get sucked in. I need to be predictable about what I believe I am a global thinker and I like to learn interactively. My thoughts need to be connected with some person or value. On reflection, don't all thoughts have to be connected to something? I feed new information into other things I've read and my thoughts, and I can have a marvelous time just sitting with ideas. And I like to discuss or write things because I seem to have a lot in my head and I've got to get it out. I love bringing together different eclectic ideas and seeing what's similar. I like to have my own ideas, hear others ideas, and have ideas challenged, bantering back and forth. Chitchat has no interest for me. I tend to do a lot of mental rehearsal and play in problem solving, and the fun part is figuring out how to do something. Motivation comes when something has real meaning or value for me, and while I enjoy ideas I don't like having my values challenged. For me, asking questions is just a different form of being quiet, a way to explore an inner thought stream or check out of reality and back into my thoughts. Sometimes I chuckle at myself that there is really no sequential way that I work though tasks... I'm concerned about how others feel when they are around me. Lack of honesty or ethics or integrity in interactions-when someone is saying one thing but doing another-really puts me off. So does when someone doesn't honor, or accept as valid, my communication or feeling as I try to talk to them about something that matters to me. And I don't need to talk about myself. I don't enjoy it. Sometimes I'm frustrated trying to communicate, and sometimes a metaphor or a joke or a story is a way to effectively express myself so what I'm saying can be heard by someone who hears or experiences things differently. I don't know what I am going to do next, but I trust in myself that something will come in as a new idea, with challenge and inner meaning. Whatever it is, it will be right. Although I would never actually say it, it feels as though I am grounded in the very being of who I am when I talk like this."

I am a reluctant leader-I like to have some say in things and I am glad I am doing it. but if things go well with someone else as leader, then that doesn't bother me Privacy is important, though it's nice to be thought of well by others. I like to have some independence; to be able to come and go as I please is nice. I am dependable and conscientious. I have a big sense of obligation with work. Doing a good job is really important to me. Give me specifics and a plan on how you want me to do it Brainstorming is generally harder-it's a skill to acquire. I prefer to work by myself without distractions because I like things done a certain way. It's taken me a while to learn that my work is much better quality when I'm drawing from those who see things differently. They help keep up my enthusiasm. And I get upset when work backs up-and it probably takes me longer than most people to do something because I am so thorough. But when I have learned a lot about what I do. I think I get the job done much faster and I can make difficult work look easy. cannot stand people not doing their best job. I do what I say I'm going to do and stick with it until it's done.

It's important to me to be able to say \"Okay. this is enough responsibility for now, I don't have to climb that ladder at any cost.\" Organization has always been a real strength. I do it all internally. in my head. I am fairly detail oriented and a very structured person. I have to have things in a certain place, with a plan and things prioritized, so I can leave things and pick up the next day where I left off. Being structured is a natural thing with me. to want to have things set... I consider myself adaptable to anyone. I feel that a lot of people think I am a nice person, and because I was always there for them in the past and willing to help, they try to take advantage of me.

I like to design-not just implementation but the stuff before that. There is a goal, a theme, and I start from that and work through the specifics one by one, keeping the whole thing integrated as I go, until I come up with \"the elegant solution.\" Often when I talk to people they only get from me a few steps-one, thirteen, a hundred. That's all that gets verbalized, and what's very clear to me either I've forgotten or find unnecessary to say out loud, which can come across as confusing at times. I am very knowledge and big picture oriented. I want to bring everything that can be known into understanding a problem or situation. I enjoy working with those who think like I do but verbalize better. We can end up leaping forward rapidly and building off of ideas, asking questions with an answer in mind but wanting to verify things and learn more. If I am knowledgeable in that area, I always have something to add, to help better understand the idea and add something new. Although sometimes, even when I know we agree, people feel like I am trying to challenge them, which is frustrating because I am just doing it out of excitement. I try to understand all the variables and possible influences and then apply as broad a range of information as I can bring to the problem, to impact why the problem exists. I am interested in developing new skills and trying new ideas with those skills, and I am a good team member, and yet sometimes a little group work can go a long way. Most of all, I love to learn. Central for me is honesty and integrity, especially intellectual integrity. If it's not an honest approach to the issue at hand or to the relationship or organization, then it becomes an illusion-it only appears to have substance. I respect people who are genuine, honest, and open and doing what they are good at and what they enjoy and are up front about what is important to them I can be seen as too unfeeling, too quick to start into work with not enough basis laid out for the day, and I'm not much for the personal amenities or socializing. Yet it is important that others are aware they are important to me. It's not the first thing, but it's in my awareness. I tend to try solving personal problems all by myself.

What matters is working at making the relationship the best that it can be at whatever level it is, building depth into it. Honesty is very important. Even if the truth is bad it adds to the depth of the relationship. It's particularly difficult when my needs aren't being met. Sometimes I can't even feel good about myself because I worry that others did not get what they needed.

I can't be successful for myself if I'm trying to fit into someone else's idea of me. I also tend to take a leadership position-not a strong one always but I'm looked at as a leader. Others having genuine confidence in me is almost as good as having the confidence myself. When someone comes for help. it's a compliment. I listen and feed some things back that maybe they haven't thought about, something that's profound for them.

If it's lack of skills, it's building skills. If it's rules or other inhibitors, I work to eliminate those. I value people, but I am quick to judge their value to the system and quick to judge my personal desire to be involved with them.

Some people need somebody to be very clear, very direct, and very to the point. That's how I operate. And work needs to be mutually enjoyable for all of the parties involved. Celebrate achievements. Recognition or reward runs very high in my value system I love the challenge of creating something pleasing to the eye. I like the order, to walk into a place that's totally chaotic, nothing's happening, and there's a great opportunity to straighten things out. I like to get the job of placing all the stuff, making it right so it works... If don't respect someone, I avoid them. If I can find another way to do business I will. I surround myself with people that I feel comfortable with, but they're totally my selection. I like taking on something that I want to do and getting it done and seeing results, keeping things moving along just to see that I have met some goals-a feeling of accomplishment in a day. I'll always take bigger risks if I feel confident enough. Then I'll work with it for a while, and if I see it's not going anywhere, I just move on and go from there. I guess that summarizes how I deal with situations."

        "content": "I have to be directly in contact with people and know that somehow I am influencing what happens for them in a positive way. That is a kind of driving force in my life, actualizing potential, giving encouragement, letting people know what I think they can do. I have been told I have this uncanny ability to absolutely zero in on and intuit what people need. I sometimes recognize something about them that they have not said to anybody else. And they say. 'How did you know?* I see myself as a facilitator. It's not about imposing what I want to see happen, although I have some grand ideal of everyone having a better life or feeling better or dealing with a particular issue. Being able to understand people in depth gives me a feeling I have been friends with them forever, and when I act too much that way, they may not be able to handle it. But I feel sad when I see potential in someone and they are either denying it or not able to access it in some way. I'm very sensitive too, but sometimes easily discouraged and I still go on thrilled to meet new people, with an interest in assisting them in whatever they are seeking. I give them both knowledge and meaning. I bring a fresh perspective and my appreciation for people's goodness. If I'm stuck for hours working at a monotonous task, I get peculiar, zonky, and weird. I get very tired if I can't get out and exchange information. I'll lack bounce, the bubbling of ideas that makes me run through life. absolutely have to have a fulfilling job or I get depressed. I want to use my talents, make a difference, and have autonomy. If not. I struggle to retain a sense of self and it's like my spirit is dying. People talk about being drawn to me. Friends are so important to me and I have good intentions. I like to think I'll do whatever I can do to hold on to them, but often I don't get around to writing or calling. They know that if they create a friendship with me, then the friendship is going to be intense and loyal and I will be there for them when they really need me. And I can engage with people that I care about who are a distance away and feel like they are a part of my life on an ongoing basis, picking up a lot of feeling from what they write or when they call. It would be easier to spin straw into gold than be totally alone.. I remember this wonderful little boy, but he was conning everyone. I kept looking straight at him, \"in the soul,\" and finally he put his hands up over his eyes and said, \"You've got to quit looking at me like that. I can look at people like that, but you can't look at me like that.\" And I completely understood him and I said, \"I know who you are, and it's not bad. It's good, you're good, and you have promise.\" That's what people don't want to hear-I see you, I value you, I care what you'll become, and I wish to be a part of that if you need me."

        "content": "I like to be involved and doing something. Much of my day is keeping contact with a lot of people. That's an important part of my life. I enjoy communicating with people, talking, going places and doing things, watching people and learning from watching. Bringing people together is a real pleasure. Sharing and time spent with friends and family, a special person, is very satisfying. I like to think about other people, and find I feel tremendous pleasure in reading them. When I see someone who just doesn't talk, sometimes I feel maybe they re missing something. I don't have trouble revealing what is very close to me, even with a complete stranger if I feel safe. Sharing confidences is a gift. I will anticipate others' needs. A perfect day is feeling I've made a difference to someone. No tension, no conflicts. just something I've solved in a way that feels good to the best of the standards I've set for myself. In my personal life, friends are important, and being a good friend and having good friends I can depend on makes life a pleasure and a joy. Long-lasting friendships or new ones-l generally care about others and they sense that. Maybe I care too much sometimes, but I want to listen to their background and rationale of why they did something. Part of me wants to tell them the answer right away. but sometimes people just want someone to listen. When I have a problem I bounce it off of people I respect and take into account how others involved will be affected. It can be difficult to take a hard line when people are going to be slighted, but sometimes I have to go through a lot of conflict, do what I must, and step on some toes. But I don't like conflict. It's hard for me to be confrontational, even to the point where I can leave myself in a bad place because I really don't have the nerve to confront someone and say really what I think needs to be said. I tend to skirt the issue, put it off, because I am very aware of hurting people's feelings. But I am not afraid to face a challenge. I will stand up for the rights of others in spite of many obstacles because I believe in justice and helping people. Intolerance and prejudice, people who don't stand by their word or lie to cover up hurting someone else-these raise the hair on the back of my neck. It turns my stomach when people intentionally take advantage of and hurt others. It's not what the person says so much as how it's being said, to the point where I don't hear the message. I want to hear where the person is coming from... I follow through on my commitments and obligations and believe in honest relationships and honest communication. I admire people who are not afraid to show affection, who are not embarrassed to try things even though they may not be good at them or are willing to make a change in their life, and who stand up for the rights of others and are not afraid to speak out when they feel someone is out of line. Personal growth means listening to myself and thinking about things, putting my priorities in order, and understanding that setbacks are only for today and that I can go on."

        "content": "Life feels like a constant state of moving from one interesting thing to another, and I can get frustrated when there isn't enough time to pursue all those interesting things. I have a wide range of interests. I love to explore the world, how other people live, what they believe in, and what their lives are like. I have a deep need to understand the human condition and what brings people to life, even above difficult odds. I like it when the conversation goes wherever it wants to go-deep imaginative, intellectual, or philosophical conversation. Going off on one theory or another is fun, but long stories with nothing to learn frustrate me. Ideas mean change. When I meet people who have interesting ideas, talents, or projects, I want to get to know them and help them make whatever they want to do possibly much bigger, more successful, or more impactful than they had intended. I start aligning with them and building trust because I want to get invited in-to probably change whatever they want to do because I tend to see more possibilities. Then we cook up the project. It's fun to learn. I enjoy that in-the-moment experience of connecting things in my mind. Challenge and intellectual stimulation get me excited. I just see a different world than the one in which I live, and I admire people who have genuine compassion and a commitment to serve others. I really respect people who have the ability to take the slings and arrows that come with leadership roles and working for change, who can cope with all the misunderstanding and resistance, who can say, \"This is an idea whose time has come and we're going to get it done.\" It's important to me to be in a setting where people are committed, where facts are respected, and where there is a space for people to tell the truth or at least look for the truth-and be open to listening... Fairness and consistency are really important. I feel that people should be treated with respect at all times, and I don't like behavior demeaning to others. When there is conflict I feel a compulsion to figure it out, to resolve it. When I'm personally involved, it can be difficult to initiate a discussion about the conflict. Sometimes I feel inadequate. I think life is a puzzle and we keep playing with how to fit the pieces together. Something new and challenging is always more interesting to me than something I am already competent at."

        "content": "I like variety. I like people. I am whatever is happening at the moment. I accomplish as much as I can to keep from getting bored-I find something I like and can tolerate, that I can see myself good at down the road. And I'm almost always up and positive. I always have a compliment and look for the good in a situation. I love the simple things in life, and I'm also interested in people and a lot of different things. I look at life's possibilities: the excitement of what might come out of a situation and what I might learn about a person and how I can help. Freedom is the most important thing. If I don't have freedom, then what do I have? I love talking to people. Making and having friends is gratifying, and I value my friendships. People see me as someone they can tell something to and not just as boring or average. Somehow I charm people, and I am very genuine in my interest. I observe the game of life, and a lot of times it's about being open and observant on my part. Whenever I find things getting heavy, I say something light to make everyone laugh again. I am offended when things are impersonal and harsh. Some people are so serious and many people feel guilty about having fun. Fun is important because I can get more work done in a few hours than most people do in a whole day. My biggest contribution is in just listening to what people are trying to do, probing and pushing and mirroring back to them what I hear they're saying. I love not having to practice and still being good at something. I don't like having to do a lot of planning. I want to accomplish something and move on to the next thing. I am really good at pulling things off, especially if there is a last-minute crisis. It's just a matter of trying to keep things together, doing what you have to do in the moment. Being outside, getting physical, is also something I have a need for. Everyone always wants me on their team. People say I'm lucky... When the moment that I am living in becomes difficult, then I close up physically. I just move through life and react as things come up. I can get worried about the future and go down this long road of awful possibilities or thinking about the past, especially if others will be affected. lam an individual. I can't imagine following others, and it's a waste of time if someone's not going to do their best. I want freedom for being able to do what I want to do when I want to do it. Don't tell me I can't do something. Rules and regulations infuriate me. Doing something by the book isn't always logical or reasonable. What makes a difference is if you do a good job or not. Do a good job and I respect you. I want to do my best."
